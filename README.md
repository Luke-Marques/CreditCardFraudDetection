# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Supervised Machine Learning

This project aims to correctly classify fraudulent transactions based off of 28 transaction factors, and the amount of
money involved in each transaction.

The [datasets provided by Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) are imbalanced, and as such a variety
of methods and models will be used in order to explore some of the methods available to deal with imbalanced
classification problems. These problems are commonplace in reality, for example, within disease diagnoses, or customer
churn prediction.
